In this Chapter we will specify in detail the system requirements and particular features to be implemented. The requirements
will be divided in two major sections.\\
\indent First we will describe what tasks the Back-end of the system should perform in order to provide
all the data and tools for supporting the system Front-end. Then we will define the tool requirements from
the user point of view. For the aggregator no requirements will be specified since this component will only bridge
requests from the Front-end and the Back-end or will eventually fetch data directly from the database.\\

\section{Social Networks Prioritization}
Before diving into the requirements we first will review our \glspl{osn} preferences regarding information extraction and the
interest we have in analyzing these specific networks.\\
\indent First we want to analyze \textbf{Facebook} because it is the most general purpose network, the most popular and the most used
thus allowing us to derive more interesting conclusions since the resultant graphs will be more realistic having a more concrete social structure
representation. Second we want to analyze \textbf{LinkedIn} because it is also widely used and the only that specifically
focus on professional worldwide networking, generating different kinds of graphs and understand how companies and professionals
are interacting online. Analyzing LinkedIn may also introduce an interesting analysis that is merging information from Facebook and
analyzing friendship networks within professional networks.\\
\indent Having two networks embedded in the system proves that we can analyze social networks in general since we have more
than one and with different purposes, but since the system is designed to simply accommodate new networks simply adding
a new extraction module should the major part of the work to integrate a new \glspl{osn}, this said we could eventually
also implement some extra modules to the remaining \glspl{osn} listed in Chapter 3.
