Visual requirements, interaction etc. etc.

\subsection{Information extraction and network structure}
\begin{enumerate}
    \item The user must be able to register available \glspl{osn} in the system;
    \item The user must be able to order the build of its network with depth I or II where:
    \begin{enumerate}
        \item Depth I - Builds network with user and user's friends;
        \item Depth II - Builds network with user's friends and friend's of friend's.
    \end{enumerate}
    \item The user must be able to \textit{blacklist} nodes specific from being extracted and consequently rendered on the user's graph;
    \item The user must be able \textit{blacklist} from the network nodes with a minimum or maximum number of connections;
    \item The user must be able to choose for each network node which details will be extracted within a given \glspl{osn} \footnote{Despite these flags being activated by the user, for privacy reasons some information will not be available, the web crawlers will never extract these kind of data}:
    \begin{enumerate}
        \item \textbf{Facebook}:
        \begin{enumerate}
            \item \textit{Relationships} - If this flag is checked, relationships will be included;
            \item \textit{Personal} details - If this flag is checked, personal details will be included;
            \item \textit{Life events} - If this flag is checked, life events will be included;
            \item \textit{Likes} - If this flag is checked, user's likes will be included;
            \item \textit{Posts} - If this flag is checked, most recent posts will be included.
        \end{enumerate}
        \item \textbf{LinkedIn}:
        \begin{enumerate}
            \item \textit{Experience} - If this flag is checked, experience will be included;
            \item \textit{Education} - If this flag is checked, education will be included;
            \item \textit{Skills} - If this flag is checked, skills will be included;
            \item \textit{Languages} - If this flag is checked, languages will be included;
            \item \textit{Projects} - If this flag is checked, projects will be included;
            \item \textit{Groups} - If this flag is checked, groups will be included;
            \item \textit{Connections} - If this flag is checked, connections will be included.
            \item \textit{following} - If this flag is checked, following will be included.
        \end{enumerate}
    \end{enumerate}
    \item The system must be clear and warn the user about the impacts that extracting some kind of data (e.g. extracting complete list of user's likes on Facebook)
    could have on extraction time and consequently on render network time (these could be expressed via label warnings in the user's interface);
    \item ...
\end{enumerate}

\subsection{Graph interaction}

\begin{enumerate}
    \item User should be able to enable and disable Fisheye Distortion alike effect (https://bost.ocks.org/mike/fisheye/);
    \item ...
\end{enumerate}

\subsection{Other operations}
\begin{enumerate}
    \item The user must be able to download his network in standard graph formats: Trivial Graph Format (TGF) and GraphML so that it could
    be imported to other \glspl{sna} tools such as Gephi or SocNetV;
    \item ...
\end{enumerate}
