\section{Final Results Summarization}

The following table summarizes the features that Socci prototype implemented.\\
(\textbf{NOTA}: Vou atualizando esta tabela à medida que os desenvolvimentos avançam, no final teremos sumarizadas as
funcionalidades oferecidas pela aplicação)\\

\section{Socii - final aspect and functionalities overview}
In this section we do an overview across Socci application, we present the overall functionalities that Socii offers
from an end user perspective.

\section{Case Study}
As we mentioned Socii uses generators to build a network for a given \gls{osn} with a specific required number of nodes. In this section we present
a real case study with real data in order to prove the accuracy of conclusions that Socii provides in a real context. For this case study we will use
a real account and extract information from Facebook using the facebook web crawler module that was developed initially as a back-end requirements to allow extraction on the fly, but not that being possible by the mentioned reasons, we use it as mean to obtain a real data set that we inject in Socii and associate to a whitelisted Socii account that besides being able of generating \glspl{osn} networks as normal users, the whitelisted users will also have available an option to consult a predefined network that is built on the fly with already stored data (the case study data).
