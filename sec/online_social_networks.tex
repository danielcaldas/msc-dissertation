%% ---------------------------------------------- Chapter Introduction

\indent \indent People need to connect other people, and the urge for connection, bring to us what today are known as \glspl{osn}.
This web sites allows to define a profile as an individual, and to share and visualize content with other individuals in the network, therefore connecting.

\begin{quote}
\textit{"We define Online Social Networks as web-based services that allow individuals to construct a public or semi-public
 profile within a bounded system, articulate a list of other users with whom they share a connection, and view and traverse
 their list of connections and those made by others within the system. The nature and nomenclature of these connections
 may vary from site to site.} \cite{ellison2007social} \footnote{A table is presented on the next page. The blank space is due to the size of the table.}

%% -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- TABLE

\indent The Table \ref{table:osns} lists the most used and popular \glspl{osn}, ordered by the estimated number of registered users.
\\\\
\indent The first obvious comment on the listed \glspl{osn} is that general purpose \glspl{osn} have more users (social
networks with the word \textit{General} in bold), being Youtube an exception, since it is not a general purpose \glspl{osn}, neither
is focused on individuals, it is build around \textbf{social objects}, the videos.
\\\\
\indent The grey scale in the first column of Table \ref{table:osns} divides \glspl{osn} in three groups: the first and smallest, the 1 billion
or more users \glspl{osn}; the second the \glspl{osn} with less than 1 billion users and more then 100 million; finally, the third group, \glspl{osn} with
less then 100 million users. At this point, we begin to observe that \textbf{the narrower purpose \glspl{osn}} such as ResearchGate (mainly for researchers) or
Couchsurfing (mainly for open minded travellers), \textbf{have a smaller number of registered users}, which is expected since the target audience is also smaller.
\\\\
\indent Other \glspl{osn} not listed in the Table \ref{table:osns}, but still worth mentioning include \textbf{Classmates} (helps users finding
classmates form kindergarten, primary school, high school etc.) known for being one of the first \glspl{osn}, since it was
launched in 1995, and \textbf{Ask.fm} (allows users to interact with other users asking and answering questions (revealing identity is optional)).

\end{figure}

\indent \indent Although the first platform possessing some of the main characteristics of \glspl{osn},
the first recognizable \gls{osn} launched in 1997 as we can observe in the Figure \ref{img:timeline}. SixDegrees.com allowed users to create personal
profiles, connect with friends and consult friends of friends lists. The profile feature came from the
online dating sites and online communities, while the surfing trough register users in the network
and consult friends was an existing feature in Classmates.com. SixDegrees.com was the first to combine
these features.

SixDegrees promoted itself as a tool to help people to connect, but in 2000, it became an
unsustainable business and the service closed. At the time the creators conclude that
SixDegrees was a service that was very ahead of its time.

Until 2002 many \glspl{osn} have emerged, but incapable of projecting themselves at a global scale.
As we can observe in the timeline of Figure \ref{img:timeline} From 2002 and 2005 \glspl{osn} the \textit{big players} came to exist, in these years, platforms
such as Friendster, LinkedIn, MySpace, Hi5, Facebook and Youtube came to existence, shaping the business, cultural
and research landscape.
