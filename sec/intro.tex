\section{Context and Problem}
In the mid 1950s sociologists introduced the term social networks, that despite being a familiar term for today general public because of the online social networks platforms such as facebook, youtube or twitter, it is a much more deeper and mature concept. It was in the 2000s that much of the online social networks we know today start emerging, so it took at least 10 years to people to adopt the concept and the new way of living, so today billions of people se these online platforms as channel for socializing, connect with each other and share they're day to day lives.\\
\indent From the user point of view we may consider that all the platforms offer a microscopic point of view from within the network, people have a public profile, and they can visualize they're friend's profile, and have normally have access to a timeline that merely displays friends activity. The point is that to the user's of this online platforms, it is not provided a mean to visualize they're network structure in a more abstract and generalized sense, where users are given the opportunity to observer they're social network from a macroscopic view, and with that all the metrics for measuring nodes and relationships within the network.\\
\indent The problem that is being built in this section resides on general social structure observation and analyzes. Visualization and Analysis of Dynamic Social Networks fills the gap or struggle that online social networks users have in understand they're network, how they relationships evolved along the time, what role they play within the network and what how can they analyze and visualize they're networks based on social properties such as mutual relationships, geographical position, personal tastes preferences or hobbies.\\
\indent Within the big data challenges, social network data analysis might be one of the biggest struggle that we face today, because besides dealing with tremendous amounts of data, we are dealing with unstructured data.
