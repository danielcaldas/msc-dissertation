\section{Context and Problem}

In the mid 1950s sociologists introduced the term social networks, that despite being a familiar term for today general public because of the \glspl{osn} platforms such as Facebook, Instagram or Twitter, it is a much more deeper and mature concept. It was in the 2000s that much of the \glspl{osn} we know today start emerging, so it took at least ten years to people to adopt the concept and the new way of living, so today billions of people use these online platforms as channels for socializing, connect with each other and share they're daily lives.\\
\indent From the user's point of view we may consider that all the platforms offer a microscopic perspective from within the network, people have a public profile, and they can visualize they're friend's profile (this is a typical scenario that we observe today in the majority of the \glspl{osn}), and have normally have access to a timeline that displays friends activity. The point is that to the user's of this online platforms, it is not provided a mean to visualize and analyze they're network structure in a more abstract and generalized sense, where users are given the opportunity to observer they're social network from a macroscopic perspective, and with that, all the metrics for measuring nodes and relationships within the network.\\
\indent The problem that is being built in this section resides on general social structure observation and analyzes. This dissertation aims to fill the gap or struggle that online social networks users have in understand they're network, how they relationships evolve along the time, what role they play within the network and what how can they analyze and visualize they're networks based on social properties such as mutual relationships, geographical position, personal tastes and preferences or hobbies.\\
\indent Within the big data challenges, social network data analysis might be one of the biggest demand that we face today, because besides of dealing with tremendous amounts of data, we are dealing with unstructured data. The unstructured data derives from the diversity of this platforms known as \glspl{osn}, and unstructured data adds complexity to the challenge of analyzing social networks data. The major challenges related with big data and unstructured data comes after the data extraction.

\subsection*{The steps for data analyzes and visualization}

Next we present the steps trough data extraction to data visualization, that generally represent the structure and flow of data analyzes and visualization systems.

\begin{itemize}
\item Data extraction trough social media APIs or trough web crawlers (also known as web scrappers);
\item Saving data, and more importantly know what data to store, in order to have an efficient system that provides a health structure for data analyzes one needs
to selected data carefully;
\item What to do with the data, what applications the stored data may have, how can the system digest and transform data in order to make it useful or interesting for the end users;
\item How to present/show the transformed data, despite the science of visualization represent only a small part of the data scientist work, it has a huge impact on the end user, mainly when targeting a general audience.
\end{itemize}

\section{Motivation}
As we seen in the previous section social media data analyzes represents a major challenge for data scientists in every aspect, since the extraction all the way to the visualization. Despite representing a major technological challenge, social media data analyzes has an additional motivation, that is the massive daily usage in every country across the planet making \glspl{osn} an universal tool for communication, such as radio or television but with the technological flavor of the 21st century.\\
\indent \glspl{osn} as we will see along this dissertation, are today a \textit{"digital mineral"} in terms of exploration potential, we do not only pretend to have a generalist perspective of the analyzes of data that flows within this platforms, we will try when appropriate to demonstrate the most narrower applications as possible of analyzing social networks, this applications may go from health analyzes within social structures, to strategic marketing planning supported by the analysis of the already mentioned unstructured data.
