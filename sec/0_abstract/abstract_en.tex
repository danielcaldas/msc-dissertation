% we do a more detailed study on Online Social Networks starting from exposing theme in a more generalist way and then narrowing and exploring some of then with more detail. In chapter 4 we cover the analysis theoretical with the tool we want to build in mind, being Social Network Analysis a very broad field we take advantage of our goals to narrow the research on this field, presenting only the concepts and tools that in a certain way built the path for Chapter 5, where we propose an yet non much detailed architecture schema and description of some features that we think that our system should implement.

This document represents the study developed under the master's thesis Analysis of Visualization of Social Networks, that overlaps
two main scientific fields, sociology (more concisely social networks) and computer science, aiming the design and implementation of a system for social
network analysis.\\

\indent First we present and identify the problem and challenge of building a system for social network analysis, we also mention the motivation,
research hypothesis and goals. From here we start to search the science foundations for social networks, starting from the very basic theoretical concepts in chapter two, then we travel to the present and present Online Social Networks as the most known application of this science, in chapter 3 we do a more detailed study on Online Social Networks starting from exposing theme in a more generalist way and then narrowing and exploring some of then with more detail. In chapter 4 we cover the analysis theoretical with the tool we want to build in mind, being Social Network Analysis a very broad field we take advantage of our goals to narrow the research on this field, presenting only the concepts and tools that in a certain way built the path for Chapter 5, where we propose the system architecture.\\

\indent The next steps are more technical, we discuss and prioritize the requirements for our system, we present out technological choices based on a proof of concept built to previous system implementation only for architectural and technological study of viability. Next we present the developed tool, the final results and respective analysis. At the end we focus on discuss the main conclusions of this work, and where could we go from here, we present possible future under different perspectives.
