\acrfull{sna} is the study of how people are connected to each other, basically it studies a set of relations among a set of entities,
these entities may be individuals, organizations, or even countries.\\\\
\indent The common analysis procedure consists in mapping the network and then creating metrics to
characterize the network. Then one tries to figure what is the structure of the network and why does
it have that structure. \glspl{sna} is also about looking at the individuals inside the network and where are those individuals located.

%% ---------------------------------------------- Fundamental Concepts for Network Analysis
\section{Fundamental Concepts for Network Analysis}

According to \cite{wasserman1994social}, the concepts listed below are of key importance to understand \glspl{sna}.

\begin{itemize}
    \item \emph{Actor} - \gls{sna} is concerned with understanding the linkages among social entities and the implications of these linkages, these social entities are described as actors. Actors are  discrete individual, corporate, or collective social units.
    \item \emph{Relational Tie} - Actors are linked to one another trough \textit{social ties}. The type of ties may be extensive, and it describes the nature of the connection. Some example of ties:
        \begin{itemize}
            \item \textbf{Evaluation} of one person by another;
            \item \textbf{Transference} of resources (business transactions);
            \item \textbf{Association} (to social event or cause);
            \item \textbf{Behavioural} interactions (communicating);
            \item \textbf{Moving} between places or statuses (migration, social or physical mobility);
            \item Others may be: physical connection (roads, rivers), formal relations (authority), biological relationship.
        \end{itemize}
    \item \emph{Dyad} - The most basic relationship that can be established is a dyad, a connection between two actors.
    \item \emph{Triad} - A relation established between three actors. Many studies included breaking \glspl{sn} down to small groups (triads), this allowed a more clear conclusion about the transitivity of the connections.
    \item \emph{Subgroup} - It defines any subset of actors in a \gls{sn} (conceptually, subgroups come after dyads and triads).
    \item \emph{Group} - A finite set of actors who for conceptual, theoretical or empirical reasons are treated as a finite set of individuals in which network measurements are made.
    \item \emph{Relation} - A collection of ties of a specific kind among members of a group is called a \textbf{relation} (e.g. a connection in \textit{LinkedIn} is a relation while evaluating our connections of sending them messages are ties).
    \item \emph{\gls{sn}} - With the definitions of actor, group and relation, a \gls{sn} consists of a finite set or sets of actors and the relation or relations defined on them. The presence of relation information is critical and defining feature of a \gls{sn}.
\end{itemize}

%% ---------------------------------------------- Graphs Theory
\section{Graphs Theory}
Graphs are typically the base of representation of social structures. This mathematical approach maps with  extreme convenience social networks. Nodes are individuals, and edges are relationships. Despite looking a quite simple approach, there is a very strong theoretical background that is of basilar importance for interpreting social networks.

%% ---------------------------------------------- Network Analysis
\section{Network Analysis}
In this section we intent to explore the scientific concepts behind network analysis, always trying to map them to reality, so only the core
and applicable concepts will be explored in this section, namely:

\begin{itemize}
\item \textbf{\textit{Power Laws}} - Power laws or power law distribution, represent in general a dependency relationship between two quantities. In \glspl{sn}, power law distribution describes a particular trend in the evolution of the number of relationships of individuals within a network;
\item \textbf{\textit{Random Graphs}} - Radom graphs are a way of generating one of the possible graph within the universe of possibilities of a given number of nodes and a given number edges. This graphs are used to map predictions to real networks;
\item \textbf{\textit{Centrality Measures}} - Centrality measures aim to answer the following question \textit{\textbf{Which vertices are important?}}. In a \glspl{sn}, an actor centrality measures the actor's interactions with other individuals;
\item \textbf{\textit{Link Analysis}} - Link analysis is a well known term form web search engines, popularized by the Page Rank algorithm. In \glspl{sn}, link analysis measures individuals connections, such as identifying strongly connected nodes, absorbing nodes or even cycles inside networks;
\item \textbf{\textit{Community Detection}} - Community detection is related to clustering in social networks. Normally when analyzing \glspl{sn} we aim for detecting communities (groups) that express similar ideas in matters such as politics, music or philosophy. Community detection is a far more abstract concept than geographical clustering, despite we often found it in \glspl{osn} such as Facebook, that the two concepts are tightly coupled;
\item \textbf{\textit{Spread of Information}} - Spread of information consists in a set of metrics that classify the propagation of the information within a network. Considering a Facebook post by a newspaper, it would come in hand to know, where was the starting point of that post, how many individuals it reaches, in which sub-networks the information was propagated, what were the entry points of for that sub-networks, how fast the information got to the individuals, these are some of the concerns relating to spread of information;
\item \textbf{\textit{Social Learning}} - Social learning consists in the change of behavior or beliefs based on direct observation of other individuals. Considering again a Facebook post by some random individual A, and consider an individual B that shares ('\textit{re-posts}') the individual's A post. If one detects a pattern in this kind of interaction, one may say that individual B is learning from individual A (imitating, mirroring).
\end{itemize}

%% ---------------------------------------------- Small World Problem
\section{Small World Problem}
This principle of \textit{small-world phenomenon} is based on the idea that all human beings are connected by \textbf{short chains of acquaintances}. The pioneer of this work was Stanley Milgram.

\subsection*{Six Degrees of Separation}
The concept of six degrees of separation is an extension of the small world problem. In the sequence of what we state before, the six degrees of separation materialize the previous concept in six interconnections for some individual to reach any other one. Six degrees of separation gained a particularly strong relevance, when a play was written in the 90's portraying the concept.

\section{Network Visualization}
Network visualization may be considered as a science by itself. In this section we will explore some relevant techniques for graph representation and visualization, we will look in particular, into \cite{beck2014state}, where a good overview is made upon graph representation approaches. We will also in a later phase of this project mentioned the graph representation technologies explored and used in this project.

\section{Real World Applications}
Here we will present some of the real world applications of \glspl{sna} with special attention for developed projects with a similar focus to this master's dissertation, and other tools of \glspl{osn} that cross many fields of studies. Two examples of projects with similar focus to this master's dissertation are:

\begin{itemize}
    \item \textit{\textbf{Vizster}} (\cite{heer2005vizster}) - Visualizing online social networks. A visualization system for playful end-user exploration and navigation of large-scale online social networks.
    \item \textit{\textbf{Project Palantir}} (\cite{project-palantir}) - This is an impressive tool that displays the rate of interactions on Facebook across the globe.
\end{itemize}
