\acrfull{sna} is the study of how people are connected to each other, basically it studies a set of relations among a set of entities,
these entities may be individuals, organizations, or even countries.\\\\
\indent The common analysis procedure consists in mapping the network and then computing metrics to
characterize the network. Then one tries to figure what is the structure of the network and why does
it have that structure. \glspl{sna} is also about looking at the individuals inside the network and where are those individuals located.

%% ---------------------------------------------- Graphs Theory
\section{Graph Theory}
Graphs are typically the base of representation of social structures. This mathematical approach maps with  extreme convenience social networks. Nodes are individuals, and edges are relationships. Despite looking a quite simple approach, there is a very strong theoretical background that is of basilar importance for interpreting social networks. In the next sections we will explore how graph theory and network analysis coexist in order to provide more formal metrics for analyzing network structures and provide information about each node within the network.

%% ---------------------------------------------- Network Analysis
\section{Network Analysis Overview}
In this section we intent to explore the scientific concepts behind network analysis, always trying to map them to reality, so only the core and applicable concepts will be explored in this section, namely:

\begin{itemize}
\item \textbf{\textit{Power Laws}} - Power laws or power law distribution, represent in general a dependency relationship between two quantities. In \glspl{sn}, the power law distribution describes a particular trend in the evolution of the number of relationships of individuals within a network;
\item \textbf{\textit{Centrality Measures}} - Centrality measures aim to answer the following question \textit{\textbf{Which vertices are important?}}. In a \gls{sn} actor centrality measures the actor's interactions with other individuals;
\item \textbf{\textit{Link Analysis}} - Link analysis is a well known term form web search engines, popularized by the Page Rank algorithm. In \glspl{sn}, link analysis measures individuals connections, such as identifying strongly connected nodes, absorbing nodes or even cycles inside networks;
\item \textbf{\textit{Community Detection}} - Community detection is related to clustering in social networks. Normally when analyzing \glspl{sn} we aim for detecting communities (groups) that express similar ideas in matters such as politics, music or philosophy. Community detection is a far more abstract concept than geographical clustering, despite we often found it in \glspl{osn} such as Facebook, that the two concepts are tightly coupled;
\item \textbf{\textit{Spread of Information}} - Spread of information consists in a set of metrics that classify the propagation of the information within a network. Considering a Facebook post by a newspaper, it would come in hand to know, where was the starting point of that post, how many individuals it reaches, in which sub-networks the information was propagated, what were the entry points for that sub-networks, how fast the information got to the individuals, these are some of the concerns relating to spread of information;
\item \textbf{\textit{Social Learning}} - Social learning consists in the change of behavior or beliefs based on direct observation of other individuals. Considering again a Facebook post by some random individual A, and consider an individual B that shares ('\textit{re-posts}') the individual's A post. If one detects a pattern in this kind of interaction, one may say that individual B is learning from individual A (imitating, mirroring).
\end{itemize}

Some of the previous listed concepts represent metrics for analyzing networks, thus requiring a more detailed explanation. In the next sections we will focus one the most fundamental metrics that will be relevant for further reference in this document. \footnote{At this point, and being network analysis basic concepts being covered it is normal that we interchangeably use the terms actor, node or vertices for denoting the same things}

%% ---------------------------------------------- Network Analysis - Fundamental Metrics
\section{Relevant metrics for network analysis}
These are crucial metrics that will be referenced within integral components of our system (that we will propose in the Chapter 5). We will use these metrics to add value to analysis features that we will provide to the end user. For that we must first address this concepts with a smaller granularity in terms of
what they represent and also in terms of what can they offer us.

\subsection{Centrality}
Centrality if often mixed with node degree. Despite node degree being in fact used for centrality calculations, these metric have some variations
that are worth to take a close look, in order to understand the different perspectives from where we can observe a particular node in a particular network.

\subsubsection*{Degree Centrality}
The \textbf{degree} of a node is equal to the his number of adjacent nodes (or simply the number of first degree connections).
So basically what do we get from this metric? When normalized the node degree value tells us the level of direct interaction of an actor with other
actors within a network.

\subsubsection*{Closeness Centrality}
Closeness centrality tells us how close an actor is to all the other actors in the network (not only with his first degree connections).\\
\indent This metric is considered a sophisticated measure of centrality in network theory. It is defined as the mean geodesic distance
(i.e., the shortest path) between a certain vertex \textit{v} and all other vertices reachable from it. This concept is normally associated to geographic distances, being actors closeness mapped to reality. Still there are abstractions that compute
this value not considering nodes as geodesic markers \footnote{Social Network Analysis - Theory and Applications: \url{https://www.politaktiv.org/documents/10157/29141/SocNet_TheoryApp.pdf}}.

\subsubsection*{Betweenness Centrality}
This measure reflects the number number of shortest paths going through a particular actor. \textbf{Nodes that
occur in many shortest paths} between other nodes in the network have a higher betweenness centrality, basically
takes into account the connectivity of the nodes' neighbors, giving a \textbf{higher value for nodes which bridge clusters} \footnotemark[2].

\subsubsection*{Eigenvector Centrality}
This measure is based on the following statement:

\begin{quote}
\textbf{\textit{"Importance of a node depends on the importance of its neighbors."}}
\end{quote}

Eigenvector centrality \footnotemark[2] measures importance of a node within a network. This measure assigns relative scores to all nodes, then if a node is connected to a \textit{high scored} node it has a bigger increment to its score then when connected to a \textit{low scored} node. One of the most famous variants of eigenvector centrality is the Google's PageRank algorithm \citep{brin1998anatomy}.

\subsubsection*{Page Rank}
PageRank algorithm \citep{brin1998anatomy} was thought as a way to rank online content in order to discover
what sites are important and really worth to consult. A simple justification is that a page may have a high PageRank when
there are many other pages that point to it, or if some pages point to it and simultaneously have a high PageRank.

\subsection{Clustering and Community Detection}
Represents the value of tendency for certain nodes to form a cluster. Normally actors within a network tend to aggregate when having some simple characteristic in common such as living in the same city, working in the same place or event frequenting the same gymnasium.\\
\indent A common approach for detecting communities is through graph clicks (subset of vertices of an
undirected graph where all vertices are connected between each other), being the normalized clustering coefficient a high value
when the network consists in a set of disjoint clicks.

\subsection{Node Dominance}
Dominance may be related with betweeness centrality but it focus particularly on node reachability. One may say that a node \textit{\textbf{v1}} dominates
a node \textit{\textbf{v2}} if \textit{\textbf{v2}} needs to go through \textit{\textbf{v1}} to reach a certain node \textit{\textbf{v3}}.

%% ---------------------------------------------- Small World Problem
\section{Small World Problem}
This principle of \textit{small-world phenomenon} is based on the idea that all human beings are connected by \textbf{short chains of acquaintances}. The pioneers of this work were Stanley Milgram and Jeffrey Travers \citep{travers1967small}.

\subsection*{Six Degrees of Separation}
The concept of six degrees of separation is an extension of the small world problem. In the sequence of what we stated before, the six degrees of separation materialize the previous concept in six interconnections for some individual to reach any other one. Six degrees of separation gained a particularly strong relevance, when a play was written in the 90's portraying the concept.

\section{Network Visualization}
Network visualization may be considered as a science by itself. In the context of this project we will not look further into network visualization, we will instead
in further Chapters (more technical Chapters) reference advanced visualization technologies that will help us on the tool implementation serving as a fundamental complement to social network analysis.
