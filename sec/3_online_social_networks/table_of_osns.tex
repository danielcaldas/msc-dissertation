\caption{\label{table:osns} Table describing most used \glspl{osn}. (\cite{statista}, \cite{expandedramblings})}
\end{table}

\indent Table \ref{table:osns} lists the most used and popular \glspl{osn}, \textbf{ordered by the estimated number of registered users}.
Also notice that, for those \gls{osn} where the number of registered users is unknown, we will assume that it is a larger value than
the monthly active users represented by the column \textit{Active Users}.
\\
\indent The first obvious comment on the listed \glspl{osn} is that general purpose \glspl{osn} have more users (social
networks with the word \textit{General} in bold), being Youtube an exception, since it is not a general purpose \glspl{osn}, neither
is focused on individuals, it is build around \textbf{social objects}, the videos.
\\
\indent The grey scale in the first column of Table \ref{table:osns} divides \glspl{osn} in three groups: the first and smallest, the 1 billion
or more users \glspl{osn}; the second the \glspl{osn} with less than 1 billion users and more then 100 million; finally, the third group, \glspl{osn} with
less then 100 million users. At this point, we begin to observe that \textbf{the narrower purpose \glspl{osn}} such as ResearchGate (mainly for researchers) or
Couchsurfing (mainly for open minded travelers), \textbf{have a smaller number of registered users}, which is expected since the target audience is also smaller.
\\
\indent Other \glspl{osn} not listed in Table \ref{table:osns}, but still worth mentioning include \textbf{Classmates} (helps users finding
classmates form kindergarten, primary school, high school etc.) known for being one of the first \glspl{osn}, since it was
launched in 1995, and \textbf{Ask.fm} (allows users to interact with other users asking and answering questions (revealing identity is optional)).
\\
\indent An important note on the listed \glspl{osn} in Table \ref{table:osns} is that only Qzone, Vine, Couchsurfing and ResearchGate don't provide any web \glspl{api}
to fetch data or publish content, while all the others offer a wide variety of web services for developers to consume and use as they please, of course within the terms and policies
of use of each \gls{osn}.
